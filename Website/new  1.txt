<h1> Alyssia and Summer's Amazing Game </h1>
<hr></hr>
<p> For this project me and Summer decided to make a hangman style of game. 
In the game there would be one player that input a word, and then passed it to 
another player to guess the letters one at a time. When/if the second player 
guessed incorrectly then pieces of a stick figure would pop up. When the entire 
stick figure popped up then the game would be over and the player would lose. 
If player two guessed correctly, then the letter that they guessed would pop up in 
the corresponding place in the original word until they guessed the entire word.</p>

<p> The most difficult part of this project would have to be getting the word that
player one inputted to transfer to the screen where player two could guess the letters.
In order to solve this we had to implement a <i>Tiny DB</i> storage device that
could store the variable on a truly global scale. Other difficulties were able to 
be fixed with for loops and variables. Overall it was an exciting and educational
expirence that I very much enjoyed.
