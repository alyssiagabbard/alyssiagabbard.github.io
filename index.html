	 <p align=center style="font-family:verdana" style="font-size:30px">	For our project, we decided to create a multiplayer game where 
	 two players interact with each other through intense battle. 
	With the use of rockets and bouncing enemies our game creates a competitive vibe that the whole family will love.
	We decided for player 1 to use 
	the WASD keys to move and the spacebar to fire rockets at player 2. 
	For player 2, we decided that the player uses arrow keys to move and the number 0 to fire rockets at player 1. 
	We faced many obstacles while creating our 
	game, especially when programing the amount of points each player receives. 
	Finally, we fixed most of the mistakes and made it 
	easier for the players, enemies, and rockets to move properly. 
	We also included an aesthetic appeal, so the players find the game visually pleasing. 
	In the end, we were very proud with our project, even though we faced many challenges.
	</p>
	<p align=center style="font-family:verdana" style="font-size:30px"> Through out the project there were times where we could not get the code to work. 
	One part in particular tooke us quite a while to get working.
	Getting the correct amount of points to the players when they deserved it. As well as the amount of points you recive when hitting the opposing player.
	Despite the hang up me and Summer worked together to overcome the obstacles and continued on with our game.

	<br></br> In the screenshot of our game we created "enemies", or the red rectangles, that moved back and fourth as the game is playing.
	The players rockets are blocked by the red rectangles to provide some sort of protection. The emnemies are set to have a random speed, so that every game has a
	uniue feel. the players objective to reach teh maximum score of, in the demos case, 10. In the game we also created "sides" for each of the players, they cannot pass
	to the other players side. </p>

	<p align=center style="font-family:verdana" style="font-size:30px"> The image to the left is the code we used to keep track of the score each player recives when they hit
	other player with their rocket. We adressed a bug where Player 1 would recive one extra point when they first hit Player 2. We created an "IF" statment that would check
	the scores of each of the players and if there was any time where Player 1's score was equal to three and playre's 2 score was equal to two we subtracted one from 
	Player 1's score. We also had trouble displaying the change when players did hit their oponent. We realized that we would have to change the variable containing the
	players score, then the promt itself, than finally telling the program to impliment the changes.

	<p align=center style="font-family:verdana" style="font-size:30px">
	Above are pictures of the finished product, where we successfully coded the point system. In the screenshot you can see that Player 1 currently has 6 points, and
	Player 2 has 8. When, and if, Player 2 obtains 10 points the score board will display "Player 2 Wins!". The players will notbe able to move, but they will have the ability
	to fire rockets and the enemies will continue to scroll.
